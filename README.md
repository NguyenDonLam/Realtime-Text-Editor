## How to co-operate
1. Open a client URL, the app will automatically adds an id into it's url
2. Copy the new URL of the document, then give it to a collaborator
3. Once collaborators opened the doc (make sure to make no changes to the doc until now) every changes to the doc will be reflected for everyone

4. If a different document is needed, open the url to the client again for a new id
